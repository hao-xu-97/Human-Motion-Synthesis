Generating Human Motion in MotionBuilder
Input: character models(fbx), mocap data(bvh), and background images(jpg)

Steps:
0. Convert mocap data to bvh from asf and amc files (if didnt do so alredy)
1. Open MotionBuilder and the python editor for it
2. Run the retargeter.py script
3. Input the folders containing the input datas when prompted
4. Wait for the videos to be rendered

Variations
Illumination- Currently non-existant 
(Previous student attempted to add them to the script, could try to improve on that)
Camera Views- Already in the script
Characters- Already in the script
Clothing- Attached to character, cant change them easily
Scene- different background images

Technical uncertainties
1. Creating realistic scenery instead of just background images
2. Incorporating different lighting
3. Current procedure is dependent on MotionBuilder interface, cant make it standalone executable

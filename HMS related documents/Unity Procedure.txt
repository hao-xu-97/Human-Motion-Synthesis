Generating Human Motion in Unity
Input: character model(fbx format) and mocap data(bvh format)

Steps:
0. Convert mocap data to bvh from asf and amc files (if didnt do so alredy)
1. Convert mocap data from bvh format to fbx format using Blender
	(Unity doesn't support the bvh format)
2. Add both the mocap data and the character model as assets in unity
3. Set animation type of both assets to humanoid 
4. Add character model onto the scene as a GameObject
5. Create a Animator Controller and attach the mocap data to it
6. Attach the Animator Controller to the character model
7. Adjust camera and lighting to desired setting
8. Run

Variations:
Illumination- Built-in directional lights in unity (can change color, position, and angle)
Camera views- Built-in camera in unity (can change position and angle)
Characters- Create new character models or find available models online
Clothing- Attached to character, hard to change individual clothing
Scene- Build scenes with assets from unity


Technical uncertainties
1. Hard to efficiently convert bvh to fbx (currently using Blender)
2. Capturing the game as videos
	(https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/75653)
	(This might work)
3. Automating the whole process (Unity scripts in C#)
	(Might be more difficult than MotionBuilder)

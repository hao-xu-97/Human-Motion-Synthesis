Varol Paper

Body Model
-SMPL body model + Blender
-http://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/

Body Shape
-CAESAR dataset
-Expensive ($10000)

Body Pose
-CMU MoCap database
-http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/search.php?subjectnumber=%&motion=%
-Instead of retargeting, use MoSh to fit SMPL parameters

Human Texture
-Extract SMPL texture maps from CAESAR scans
-Extract textures obtained from 3D scans of subjects with normal clothing
-Replace faces for anonymity

Light
-Spherical Harmonics shader in Open Shading Language
-https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage
-9 coefficients between -0.7 to 0.7

Camera
-Resolution 320X240, focal length 60mm, sensor size 32mm
-Center of viewport points to pelvis
-Random distance (mean 8, deviation 1), random yaw angle

Background
-Static background image
-LSUN dataset
-https://github.com/fyu/lsun

Procedural Generation of Videos to Train Deep Action Recognition Networks Paper

Action Scene Composition
-MOCAP dataset or programmatic actions defined using procedural animation techniques
-Environment from pre-made 3D models obtained from Unity Asset Store (Many are free)

Camera
-Kite Camera attached to character
-Can follow with/without delay or be stationary

Actions
-CMU MOCAP database
-Form "atomic" motions from data to procedually generate realistic action categories
 (atomic motions as individual movements of a limb in a larger animation sequence.
 For example, atomic motions in a ”walk” animation include movements such as rising a
left leg, rising a right leg, and pendular arm movements.)

Ragdoll Physicss
-15 movable body parts
-Use RootMotion’s Puppet-Master2 for implementing and controlling human ragdolls in Unity®Pro.

Video generation
-Lengths between 1-10s @30fps w/ 340X256px
-Use anti-aliasing, motion blur, and standard photo-realistic cinematic effects.
